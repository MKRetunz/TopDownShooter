# TopDownShooter
A top down shooter made in Unity by Martijn Klok (https://github.com/MKRetunz)

For now this project contains the basics for a top-down shooter game: 
 - enemy
 - player
 - scene 
 - control 
 - enemy spawner. 

What is planned to be added at a later date is the following:
 - Menus
 - Selectable characters
 - Randomly generated levels
 - Varying enemies

These features will most likely be added over the coming year.

##This project is currently on hold and will be continued at a later date.
